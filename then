1.The states of promises in JavaScript
A promise has three states:

pending: the promise is still in the works
fulfilled: the promise resolves successfully and returns a value
rejected: the promise fails with an error
The fulfilled and rejected states have one thing in common: whether a promise is fulfilled or rejected, the promise is settled. So a settled state could either be a fulfilled or a rejected promise.



2. catch() method provides a callback.

The callback is a function to run when a promise is rejected.



3. then() method provides two callbacks:

One funtion to run when a promise is fulfilled and one funtion to run when a promise is rejected.
